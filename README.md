# Projectify


### Project Description:

Projectify is a web-based platform designed to streamline the management of IT projects using the kanban methodology. With its intuitive interface and robust feature set, the system empowers teams to efficiently plan, execute, and monitor their projects from start to finish.

Upon logging in, users are greeted with a dashboard displaying their active kanban boards. They can create new boards, each representing a distinct project, and customize them by defining columns that align with their workflow stages. Tasks/cards can then be created within these columns, detailing specific activities or deliverables required to move the project forward.

One of the key features of the system is its drag-and-drop functionality, which enables users to effortlessly move tasks/cards across columns as they progress through the project lifecycle. Notifications keep team members informed about task assignments, due dates, and any updates made to tasks/cards, ensuring everyone stays on the same page.

The system also offers powerful search and filter capabilities, allowing users to quickly find relevant tasks/cards and focus on what matters most. Integration with popular IT tools further enhances collaboration and productivity, enabling seamless communication and data exchange between platforms.

With comprehensive activity tracking and reporting features, users can monitor project progress, identify bottlenecks, and make informed decisions to keep projects on track. Whether managing a small development team or overseeing complex IT initiatives, the IT Kanban Project Management System provides the tools and flexibility needed to deliver projects successfully.


### Business Requirements:

1. **User Authentication**: The system should support user authentication to ensure secure access to the platform.

2. **Kanban Board Creation**: Users should be able to create multiple kanban boards, each representing a different IT project.

3. **Customizable Columns**: The system should allow users to define custom columns for each kanban board, reflecting the stages of their project workflow (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Testing, Done).

4. **Task Management**: Users should be able to create tasks/cards within each column of the kanban board, with options to assign tasks to team members, set due dates, and add descriptions.

5. **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Tasks/cards should be movable across columns using drag-and-drop functionality, enabling users to easily update the status of their tasks.

6. **Notifications**: The system should provide notifications to users for task assignments, due dates, and any updates made to tasks/cards.

7. **Search and Filter**: Users should be able to search for specific tasks/cards within a kanban board and apply filters based on criteria such as assignee, due date, or priority.

8. **Integration**: The system should offer integration with popular IT tools such as JIRA, GitHub, or Slack for seamless collaboration and workflow management.

9. **Activity Tracking**: The system should maintain a log of all user activities within each kanban board, allowing users to track changes and monitor project progress over time.

10. Reporting: Users should have access to basic reporting features, including task completion rates, time tracking, and project milestones.
